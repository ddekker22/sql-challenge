# sql-challenge

This code is based on instruction given in the data analytics bootcamp. Additional references were made to https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/ and the documentation for making an online ERD. 

Queries are listed in the "Data Analysis.sql" file under the sql-queries folder.
The table schemata is listed under "Import Tables.sql" in the sql-queries folder.
An ERD of the tables is given as a .png file "Employee_ERD".

References to stack overflow were made to better understand joining multiple tables at once and the correct syntax for listing and referencing foreign keys. All other information was based off of in-class work and discussion.
